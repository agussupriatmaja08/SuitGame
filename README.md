# SuitGame

The "Suit Game" project is created using the JavaScript programming language. In this game, users will face off against the computer. The Suit game itself is a traditional game played by two people. In this game, users choose one of three symbols, namely rock, scissors, or paper, to compete against the computer's randomly generated choice. The main objective of the game is to win each round based on traditional rules, where rock crushes scissors, scissors cuts paper, and paper covers rock. Enjoy playing!
